SSU
===

SSU is a programmatic interface to your bank. It was originally designed
and conceived as part of Wesabe's infrastructure and has since been
open-sourced. Its original design goal was to extract [OFX][ofx] data
given bank usernames and passwords for use on wesabe.com.

[ofx]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Financial_Exchange

The system it uses to get this data is XulRunner, a project from Mozilla
that provides a customizable (and scriptable) browser. SSU has scripts
for each financial institution it supports that describes how to log in
and download data from that institution's web site.

It was originally written in JavaScript but is currently mostly
[CoffeeScript][CoffeeScript]. You can write bank scripts in either language, though
CoffeeScript will be the preferred one going forward.

Why would I use this?
---------------------

If you're trying to aggregate transaction data from multiple financial
institutions, possibly for a large number of people, then this project
might be useful to you.


How do I try this out?
----------------------

First, clone the SSU repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/wesabe/ssu

The easiest way to try this is on your laptop/desktop computer running
Linux or Mac OS X. Windows isn't supported. SSU comes with a bunch of
scripts for financial institutions that it already supports. Your
initial experience trying out SSU is going to be much easier if you have
an account at one of these institutions. To check, go to the
[fi-scripts][fi-scripts] folder and start looking for your bank. Let's
say your bank is Chase, whose site is chase.com. We store the scripts
for financial institutions in a reverse DNS folder structure, so you
need to look in the `com` directory for the `chase.js` script.

[fi-scripts]: https://github.com/wesabe/ssu/tree/master/application/chrome/content/wesabe/fi-scripts

If your financial institution is supported, then great! Next you'll need
to install XulRunner. If you're on Linux, you'll want to use your
package manager (e.g. `apt-get`). If you're on OS X you can use the
bundled setup script:

    ssu$ ./bootstrap

That'll install it if it's not installed and tell you the version you
have installed if it is already. Now go ahead and start the app itself
in a terminal window:

    ssu$ bin/server

You'll see some logging output along with some startup messages and a
blank browser window titled "Wesabe DesktopUploader". As long as you
don't see any errors you should be good to go. Next you can generate
a credentials file to test with. Again, let's assume you have an
account at Chase. In another terminal window, run this:

    ssu$ script/generate credential com.chase chase

May require:
    sudo gem install templater

That'll create a file at `credentials/chase` that looks like this:

    {"creds": {"username": "FIUSERNAME", "password": "FIPASSWORD"}, "fid": "com.chase"}

Just change `FIUSERNAME` and `FIPASSWORD` to your username and password
for Chase and save the file.

Now fire up the test client and start a job:

    ssu$ script/console
    >> job.start chase

Your first terminal window and the blank browser should now be doing
something -- ideally logging into your financial institution site and
getting your recent transaction data. If it succeeds it'll store the
downloaded statement's in the app's profile directory. You can get a
list like so from the console:

    >> statement.list
    => ["1D8787AA-6D2D-0001-DFF3-9EB052301CD4"]
    >> statement.read "1D8787AA-6D2D-0001-DFF3-9EB052301CD4"
    => "OFXHEADER:100\r\n..."

Congrats, you've successfully gotten data out of your financial
institution's website!


So how do I use this for real?
------------------------------

The only known application that uses it is the one that used it at
Wesabe: [pfc][pfc], specifically [this file that controls the SSU
process][daemon] and [this file to talk to it][sync_job].

[pfc]: https://github.com/wesabe/pfc
[daemon]: https://github.com/wesabe/pfc/blob/master/app/models/ssu/daemon.rb
[sync_job]: https://github.com/wesabe/pfc/blob/master/app/models/ssu/sync_job.rb

Basically, SSU listens on a socket (at port 5000 by default) for lines
of JSON issued as commands. Here's a sample command JSON line:

    {"action":"statement.list", "body":null}

That calls the `statement.list` action with no extra data. Here's one
that starts a job with credentials:

    {"action":"job.start",
     "body":{"fid":"com.ingdirect",
             "creds":{"username":"joesmith","password":"iamgod"}}}

You'll similarly get responses back as JSON lines:

    # a successful response to the `statement.list` action
    {"response": {"status": "ok",
                  "statement.list": ["1D8787AA-6D2D-0001-DFF3-9EB052301CD4"]}}

    # an example error response
    {"response": {"status": "error", "error": "ReferenceError: foo is not defined"}}

You can use any programming language you like that supports spawning
processes and network sockets to manage an SSU instance. This project
ships with really basic examples in the [server][server] (spawning) and
[console][console] (communication & managing via [api.rb][api.rb]) scripts.

[server]: https://github.com/wesabe/ssu/blob/master/bin/server
[console]: https://github.com/wesabe/ssu/blob/master/script/console
[api.rb]: https://github.com/wesabe/ssu/blob/master/script/api.rb

My bank isn't supported. Can I add it?
--------------------------------------

Yep, there's a generator for that which will build a skeleton script for
your financial insitution:

    ssu$ script/generate player com.ally "Ally Bank" https://www.ally.com/
    Generating with player generator:
         [ADDED]  application/chrome/content/wesabe/fi-scripts/com/ally.js
         [ADDED]  application/chrome/content/wesabe/fi-scripts/com/ally/login.js
         [ADDED]  application/chrome/content/wesabe/fi-scripts/com/ally/accounts.js

You can probably leave the base script (`ally.js` in this example)
alone and start filling in `login.js` with the info required to navigate
the site. Once you've added something and created a matching credential
file, go ahead and try it out:

    ssu$ script/console
    >> job.start ally

There are lots of examples in the `fi-scripts` directory for you to
reference as you build your own script. Once you're satisfied just
commit your files and send a pull request so we can add your financial
institution for others to use.


Why use a browser?
------------------

Using XulRunner means that SSU can access any bank site that Firefox
can, so you don't have to use mechanize or some other tool that doesn't
fully emulate the browser environment. This matters because, by its
nature, navigating any website in a scripted way is brittle and anything
we can do to reduce the breakage is good. Websites are intended to be
viewed in web browsers and their authors worked hard to make that
function properly -- that is work you don't have to do when you use a
browser as your scraper.
